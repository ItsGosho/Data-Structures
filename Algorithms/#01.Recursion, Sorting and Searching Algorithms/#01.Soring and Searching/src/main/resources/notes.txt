----MERGE SORT---
1.It can be implemented both recursively and iterative
  PROS and CONS:
    - The recursively way can be used with threads ,which will achieve the Divide and Conquer meaning of the whole alghorithm
    (Not 100% sure ,but if the merging and sorting doesn't collied with the indexes in the iterative way it will be easy)
    - The recursively way can full the stack
    - The iterative way can't full the stack ,because the CPU will get it
- With simple words ,the whole idea is to achieve n + log(n) ,because in the iterative way the first n iteration can be seen more easily and the rest one are the merging
